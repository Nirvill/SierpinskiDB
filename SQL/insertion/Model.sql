    ('1', 'ARAR', 'Ara', '185', 'ARAR (Allzweck-Reparatur-Arbeiter Replika), (All-Purpose Repair Worker Replika \'Macaw\') or Ara, are Generation 2 Low-Cost General Purpose Replikas used in Repair, Maintenance, Construction and Production of Industrial goods.', 'Even though they may seem like quiet simpletons, do not underestimate Aras. While they may not show it, they judge those who are rude or unkind harshly and will quietly share this judgment with their entire Cadre. Aras get along best with Eules, who tend to be patient and friendly, and have a talent for reading Aras\' expressionless faces. In many facilities, Aras will construct service tunnels accessible only to them, often under floors and in walls. Unstable units may retreat into these tunnels. It is not recommended to attempt to retrieve them. Ara Personalities can be stabilized by allowing them access to plants to take care of, ideally colorful flowers or trees '),
    ('2', 'EULR', 'Eule', '175', 'EULR (Einfache Universelle Leichte Replika), (Simple Universal Light Replika \'Owl\') or Eule, are Generation 4 Low-Cost General Purpose Replikas. These units are the standard multi-purpose unit of the Eusan Nation deployed in domestic tasks such as serving as Cooks, Nurses, Cleaning, as well as Simple Medical and Office', 'Eules tend to form large groups and like to sing and dance, as the original neural pattern for this unit was a ballet dancer. Persona degradation can be easily prevented in this unit by making sure they have access to music (through tape players or musical instruments). Always place at least one mirror in Eule dorms, as they have a strong urge to check their own appearance at regular intervals. Eules\' Persona stabilizes by keeping a tidy appearance and through regular social interactions. Eules will often organize in groups of roughly ten units and give each other themed nicknames '),
    ('3', 'KLBR', 'Kolibri', '152', 'KLBR (Kommando-Leiteinheit Bioresonanztechnik-Replika), (Commando Control Unit Bioresonance Technology Replika \'Hummingbird\') or Kolibri, are Generation 6 High-Tech Bioresonance Specialist Replikas. These Units are used as Commando Control Units, using their Bio-resonance to increase squad cohesion as well as improve the mental stability of all units in a squad. Their role is described as being an \'Elite Protektor\'.', 'Great care should be given to Kolibris - their neural patterns are very unstable and their Bioresonance module makes them very susceptible to influence from others. Like most bioresonant individuals, Kolibris will often subconsciously create an emotional feedback loop, imitating and then broadcasting the emotions of those around them, acting as a sort of amplifier. While they are trained to recognize and disengage this behavior, already unstable units can sometimes spiral into Persona degradation. Due to their bioresonant connection, neural pattern development in Kolibris varies less than in other models. The constant exchange of memories and emotions between units of a Cadre acts as a "safety net" that buffers extreme changes. However, once a majority of units in a Cadre degrade, they will drag the remaining units down with them. Because of this, it is important to decommission Kolibri units instantly when they begin to degrade. For Persona stabilization, Kolibris should have access to a well-stocked library '),
    ('4', 'LSTR', 'Elster', '178', 'LSTR (Landvermessungs-/Schiff-Techniker Replika), (Land Survey/Ship Technician Replika \'Magpie\') or Elster, are Generation 5 Kosmo-Pioneer Specialist Replikas designed to assist in orbital missions and are Combat Engineers and Technicians. These units were primarily used in the Penrose mission due to their survivability and adaptability in volatile and isolated conditions.', 'Elster units were chosen for the Penrose Program for their adaptability and reliability under long-term isolation conditions. Stoic and reserved, Elster units have a relatively stable neural pattern. It is best for you to leave it alone and interact with the Elster unit as little as possible. Elsters\' neural pattern was a soldier of Vinetan origin, so their needs are basic. Avoid talking to the Elster unit about the war. Penrose vessels are fitted with a specialized calibration pod which may help with Persona stabilization. To avoid resurfacing of Gestalt memories, do not show or give the Elster unit photographs, especially of soldiers during the war. Do not show the Elster unit movies, or let it listen to music. Do not try to befriend the Elster unit '),
    ('5', 'MNHR', 'Mynah', '260', 'MNHR (Minenarbeit-,Nukleartechnik-,Hochsicherheits-Replika), (Mining, Nuclear Tech, High-Security Replika \'Mynah\') or Mynah are Generation 3 Industrial Specialist Replikas. These units are used in the mines below Sierpinski and across the Eusan Nation.', 'This neural pattern is extremely stable. Little has to be done to keep Mynahs happy. They get along well with most other models thanks to their sometimes submissive, sometimes motherly personality. Unlike other models, diary-keeping is not mandatory for Persona stabilization. Small stuffed animals may be given as fetish objects, though those resembling cats should be avoided as they might cause resurfacing Gestalt memories. '),
    ('6', 'STAR', 'Star', '220', 'STAR (Sicherheitstechniker-Aufseher-Replika), (Security Technician Guard Replika \'Starling\') or Star, are Generation 4 Low-Cost Combat Replikas. These units are Protektor Security Technicians Guards.', 'Despite their normally laid-back demeanor, STARs have a strong internal hierarchy, which is important to take into consideration when promoting units to officers. Not promoting a respected unit or promoting a unit low in status can lead to friction within dorms. STARs will occasionally develop in-group rules involving physical punishments. It is recommended to allow some Officers to own military weapons as Fetish objects to stabilize their Persona '),
    ('7', 'STCR', 'Storch', '240', 'STCR (Sicherheitstechniker-Controller-Replika), (Security Technician Controller Replika \'Stork\') or Storch, are Generation 5 Combat Lead Replikas. These units are deployed as overwatch and coordination of STARs.', 'Storch units initially have a short temper. Training them in patience early after deployment is key, as their neural patterns are less stable then other models. Failing to do so may yield an extremely volatile personality prone to cruelty and violence. A common strategy is pairing them closely with an older STAR unit. Storch\'s Persona stabilizes by showering or bathing. Books on history or mythology work well as Fetish objects '),
    ('8', 'SAPR', 'Schnäpper', '260', 'SAPR (Schwere Anti-Panzer Replika) also known as a Schnapper is a hinted at Combat Variant of the MNHR unit that does not appear within the game. (only mentioned in Replika Overview: MNHR)', ' '),

    ('10', 'ADLR', 'Adler', '175', 'ADLR (Administration-, Datenverarbeitung-, Logistik-Replika), (Administration, Data Processing, Logistics Replika \'Eagle\') or Adler, are Generation 5 High Command Specialist Replikas. Adlers are Protektor Führungskommando Administrator units.', 'Adler\'s are described as being best in isolation, not working well with each other. They are designed to be heavily dependent on their Falke units, specifically from an emotional standpoint. They are also fairly susceptible to Bioresonance making them easy to control, likely an addition that correlates with their dependency on the heavily bioresonant Falkes. However they can get bored fairly easily and require many fetish objects to remain stable '),
    ('11', 'FKLR', 'Falke', '250', 'FKLR (Führungskommando-Leiteinheit-Replika), (Operational Command Control Unit Replika \'Falcon\') or Falke, are Generation 6 High-Tech Bioresonance Command Replikas. These Replikas are used in every AEON facility across the Eusan Nation as the commander of the Protektor security forces of these facilities.', ' ');
